Every student must submit their presentation feedback to the instructor in order to satisfy the attendance requirement.

## Homeworks
There are four homeworks, one on each of the core topics: spreadsheets; SQL; data APIs; ML APIs. Students are split into groups at the start of the semester and all homeworks are completed as groups. 

## Quizzes
There are six take-home style quizzes that students complete individually on Canvas.
