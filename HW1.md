# Spreadsheet experiments

In this project you will apply the spreadsheet and markdown knowledge gained in the previous quizzes.

Your group must write an essay in Jupyter notebook format using Google Colaboratory.

Prior to writing the essay, your group must devise and complete a simple experiment, then record, analyze, and visualize the results using spreadsheets.
In your essay, you will tell us about all of the details, share the data, and tell the story of what motivated you to do this particular experiment, why the data you gathered is interesting, and how you collected it.
For example, a previous group once tracked the number of passengers on the Emory C Route to assess the extent to which wait times coincided with class times. See this [getting started template](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WtxpK4xHtpp6NlFYkaMpTKw4CKYhFwlT?usp=sharing) to see a limited example of their work.

Your group might choose to explore a similar story by exploring walking times instead (e.g. measure how long it takes you to walk between common landmarks on campus and compare with the predictions made by mapping software). Use your creativity, the grading rubric rewards this.

## Project deliverables
* Submit the link to your colab notebook.
* Within your notebook, provde links to all the data you use and all of the spreadsheets you use for analysis and visualizations. 
* Utilization of data includes points for groups which produce easily reproducible projects. That is, projects which anyone in the class can open and begin modifying to answer variations on questions that were asked.
* After the projects have been graded, groups will be invited to share their notebooks with the class by providing the link. This is voluntary. The shared notebooks will be available as an internal blog for the class to use to learn from.
