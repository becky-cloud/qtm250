# The stories behind names
In this project you will apply the SQL knowledge gained in the previous quizzes.

Your group must write an essay in Jupyter notebook format using Google Colaboratory.

In your essay, you must state a well-defined thesis on a factor that you think influences how common or uncommon a name is in the [USA Name public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/social-security-administration/us-names) . Here is [a lab to get you started](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/3616?parent=catalog). 

For example, a previous group once explored whether or not a name which was a main character in a bestselling book became more popular or less popular.

Your group might choose to explore a similar story in movies instead. Use your creativity, the grading rubric rewards this.

## Project deliverables

* Submit the link to your colab notebook here
* Within your notebook, there should be links to all the data you use and all queries your run. For example, store the tables from the queries in cloud storage, or a Github repo, and share them using those tools.
* Utilization of data includes points for groups which produce easily reproducible projects. That is, projects which anyone in the class can open and begin modifying to answer variations on questions that were asked.
* You must have queries on the USA Names dataset in your project. Note, you can augment this with external data (such as babynames dataset, or others you found). 
* After the projects have been graded, groups will be invited to share their notebooks with the class by providing the link. This is voluntary. The shared notebooks will be available as an internal blog for the class to use to learn from.
